Gameplay Todos

1.  Create a Deck - edit deck (add, remove cards)
2.  "Buy Cards" - card packs
3.  Game board
4.  Game board animations hand to board, moving cards around (card kinematics lol)
5.  Game System - Deck size, life points, win condition, phases, combat, drawing etc.
6.  Website flow - Showcase game demo (immediate playable sample game on landing page), auth (accounts to save card data to), store page, deck building page, game start page.

Longterm goals

1. Chess like game mode (pending 3D support, could also copy chess.com for now)
   NOTE: Chess.com is roughly 3 clicks to start a game with a bot
